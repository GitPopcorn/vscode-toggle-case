# Change Case

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/pranshuagrawal/vscode-toggle-case.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/pranshuagrawal/vscode-toggle-case)

Since changing the case is a frequent requirement during development and general writing, there needs to a better way to do this. This [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PranshuAgrawal.toggle-case) provides a faster, easy to remember and user friendly ways to change case of the selected text. 

You can use `Keyboard Shortcut`, `MacOS Touchbar` or `VS Code Command Palette` to change the case.

This extension supports multiple ways to change the case and it works on both single and multi cursors.

# Usage

- Press the defined keybord shortcut to toggle through various cases. And dont worry you will never loose your original text since that is also included in the cycle.
    - Cmd + M on MacOS
    - Ctrl + M on Windows

- Or if you want to change text to a particular format, you can select the text (multiple selection works too) and open Command Pallette (defaults to Cmd + Shift + P in MacOS) and start typing `Change case to ` and select the required case.
